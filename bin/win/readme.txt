To get the binaries for windows:-

1) Chrome
Download http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/google_chrome_portable and extract to bin/win/GoogleChromePortable in this folder.
create a folder "bin/win/chrome-profile" to store the chrome profile information in.

2) Node JS:
Go to http://nodejs.org/download/ then select Windows Binary (.exe) 32-bit and save to bin/win/node.exe

3) https://github.com/sihorton/sihorton-vfs this module should be a submodule of the project.
This means it is in its own repository but should be checked out under bin/win/node_modules/sihorton-vfs.
If it was not correctly checked out as a submodule then please git clone the repository
somewhere on your computer then copy and paste the folder to the node_modules directory.
